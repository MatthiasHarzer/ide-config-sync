## Setup
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MatthiasHarzer/ide-config-sync/releases) and add the executable to your `PATH`.
2. Create an empty Git repository as a Database on an online service (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to store and sync your IDE settings.
3. Run `ide-config-sync init --url <URL>` with the URL of the repository from step 2.

## Usage
> All commands support the `--dir <directory>` flag to search and save/restore IDE settings in a specific directory. If no directory is specified, the current directory is used.

### Save IDE settings
1. Run `ide-config-sync save` to crawl the current directory recursively and save all IDE settings inside the Database-Repository.

### Restore IDE settings
1. Run `ide-config-sync restore` to restore all IDE settings from the Database-Repository to the current directory.

### Dry run / discover
1. Run `ide-config-sync discover` to see which IDE settings would be saved or restored.

## Supported IDEs
- Visual Studio Code (`.vscode`)
- JetBrains IDEs (`.idea`)

## How it works
1. The tool searches the directory for Git repositories and their associated remotes.
2. All IDE specific folders inside the repository are saved to the Database-Repository, related to the repositories remote URL.
3. To restore the IDE settings, the tool searches the Database-Repository for the remote URL of the current directory and restores the IDE settings.
